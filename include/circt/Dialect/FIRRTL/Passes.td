def LowerCHIRRTLPass : Pass<"firrtl-lower-chirrtl", "firrtl::FModuleOp"> {
  let summary = "Infer the memory ports of SeqMem and CombMem";
  let description = [{
      This pass finds the CHIRRTL behavioral memories and their ports, and
      transforms them into standard FIRRTL memory operations.  For each
      `seqmem` or `combmem`, a new memory is created.  For every `memoryport`
      operation using a CHIRRTL memory, a memory port is defined on the
      new standard memory.

      The direction or kind of the port is inferred from how each of the memory
      ports is used in the IR. If a memory port is only written to, it becomes
      a `Write` port.  If a memory port is only read from, it become a `Read`
      port.  If it is used both ways, it becomes a `ReadWrite` port.

      `Write`, `ReadWrite` and combinational `Read` ports are disabled by
      default, but then enabled when the CHIRRTL memory port is declared.
      Sequential `Read` ports have more complicated enable inference:

      1. If a wire or register is used as the index of the memory port, then
         the memory is enabled whenever a non-invalid value is driven to the
         address.
      2. If a node is used as the index of the memory port, then the memory is
         enabled at the declaration of the node.
      3. In all other cases, the memory is never enabled.

      In the first two cases, they can easily produce a situation where we try
      to enable the memory before it is even declared. This produces a
      compilation error.
